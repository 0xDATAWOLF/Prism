# Prism
Prism is a 2D game engine that utilizes OpenGL and developed in C++. The goal of the project is to create an extensible
game engine from scratch.

## Getting Started 
To get started, simply clone the project with:

```
git clone https://github.com/0xDATAWOLF/Prism --resursive
```

The project uses premake to build the necessary project files for the platform (Visual Studio, Xcode, etc.).
This automatically creates the necessary links to the dependencies and establishes post-build steps for linking
the engine shared library to the *Sandbox* environment. Premake is already included in the `./build_tools` directory.

```
./build_tools/premake_[platform]/premake5 [IDE environment: xcode4, vs2019]
```

## Current Dependencies

* **OpenGL** – The graphics framework of choice for the project.
* **GLFW** The window framework. It is cross-platform, perfect for
	porting to other operating systems.
* **spdlog** A logging library because *no one* needs to reinvent this wheel.

## Feature List
